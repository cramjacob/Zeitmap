# Zeitmap

Zeitmap is a map of the Contintal US that shows the news sentiment of each state from 9/17/2016 until 7/27/2017. Dark blue shows an unhappy sentiment while yellow shows happy. 
The name is a combination of the word Zeitgeist meaning _"The defining spirit or mood of a particular period of history as shown by the ideas and beliefs of the time"_ and map.
